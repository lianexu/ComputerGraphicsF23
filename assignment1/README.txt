-Compile/Run Code: by “make”, “./assignment1 name.spline”. I used macos.
-Collaboration: I got general help from office hours to get started on the assignment
-References: the lecture slides
-Known problems: none. Except an artifact at the top of the teapot lid where the dark spot is supposed to be (but https://piazza.com/class/llv8yxf334175o/post/121 said it shouldn’t be a problem)
-Extra credit: none
-Comments: I spent a lot of time on this assignment, but I also felt like I learned a lot. The c++ learning curve (ha ha curve) was steep. Make sure you scroll out when viewing artifact1.spline and artifact2.spline. artifact1 is supposed to be a flag on a pole, artifact2 is a curtain, artifact3 is abstract art.
